# Technical evaluation
#####  What will I be evaluated on?

- Approach
 - Clean coding practices
 - Idiomatic Kotlin usage
 - Choice of data structures
#### Brownie points
Try to keep the time-complexity minimal. O(1) or O(n) wherever possible

### Take your pick 
Pick 1 (or 2) and share your screen. You may be asked to make further modifications on your pick(s).
###### IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio or whichever is your favorite
###### Language: Kotlin
###### Challenge #1
Given a string which contains only parentheses, write a program to check if it is balanced or not.
ex: (( ))  is balanced, (( ) is not balanced
###### Challenge #2
Detect a palindrome, input can be digits or characters.
ex: 1001 is a palindrome, DANCE is not a palindrome
###### Challenge #3
Find the largest number in an array of size n. Solve in O(n) time-complexity
ex: arr = [3,2,10,0,-30] , largest = 10

#### What we are flexible about
We know it is an online round with time constrain. Many-a-times you will be not be penalized for a program that does not completely run as long as you demonstrate good coding skills and choice of algorithms, but the final call on this is always up to the panel.

#### Solve
Solve your pick. Feel free to change your question, although do not do this if you have already spent a good amount of time on your first pick.

#### Happy coding!
